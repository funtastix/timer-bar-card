# Timer Bar Card

A progress bar display for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] timers.

The card currently supports **timer** components and [a few more integrations](#integration-support-status).

![Screenshots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/readme.png)

With a bit of work, you can also [configure the card](#use-with-unsupported-entities) to suppport other types of entities‚Äîeven plain switches that have automations.

For numerical quantities or percentages, you may be interested in the unaffiliated [bar card](https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card).

If your integration is not listed here, there's a high chance you'll need to [look at your entity's attributes and configure the card](#use-with-unsupported-entities) to make the card work with the integration.

## Install

Timer Bar Card is available from [HACS][hacs]. If you don't have HACS installed, follow the [manual installation](#manual-installation) instructions.

## Options

| Name              | Type    | Requirement     | Description                                          |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------    | -------------------------------------------          |
| type              | string  | **Required**    | `custom:timer-bar-card`                              |
| entity            | string  | **Optionalish** | Display a single entity, for use in `entities` cards |
| entities          | list    | **Optionalish** | Display multiple entities in a card                  |

Either `entity` or `entities` must be supplied. Use `entity` if you'd like to embed the timer inside a card, or `entities` if you would like to create your own card (and use the card options at the end of this section).

### Nonstandard Entity Config

‚Ä† requires a `start_time` attribute to calculate when in the future the timer will start. \
‚Ä° `waiting_state` and `pause_state` will still have an effect, but the card will disregard `active_state` if it can guess the timer mode.

### Card options

<details>
<summary>Expand: Customize the header and display of entities within the card. To use the card, <code>entities</code> must be defined.</summary>

 | Name             | Type    | Requirement  | Description                                             | Default |

</details>

### Actions

You can also use [actions](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/actions/) with this card to trigger services or perform actions in the dashboard when the card is clicked. The action configuration options are `hold_action`, `tap_action`, and `double_tap_action`.

## Examples

### A Basic Example

<img alt="Screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/basic.png" width="445" height="165" />

```yaml
type: custom:timer-bar-card
entities:
  - timer.alarm
  - timer.alarm_two
  - timer.alarm_three
```

### Receding progress bar

By default, the progress bar will expand. If you'd like the bar instead to shrink (as if it were counting down, rather than counting up), reverse the bar direction and invert the percentage:

<img alt="Screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/receding.png" width="378" height="42" />

```yaml
bar_direction: rtl # omit this for a left-aligned progress bar
invert: true
```

This example uses the `bar_radius` option to round the edges of the progress bar. I like my progress bars advancing from left to right, but you can keep the bar aligned to the left by omitting `bar_direction: rtl`.

### Use with [OpenSprinkler integration][opensprinkler]

<img alt="Screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/sprinkler.png" width="457" height="168" />

```yaml
entities:
  - sensor.s14_station_status
  - sensor.s15_station_status
  - sensor.s16_station_status
type: custom:timer-bar-card
name: Sprinkler
active_state: # This option isn't needed due to the defaults
  - manual
  - program
bar_width: 35%
compressed: true
filter: true # So only the running and scheduled stations are shown
```

### Use with LG Washer Dryer:

For LG Washer Dryers to work, `duration` and `remain_time` need to be configured:

```yaml
entity: sensor.washer_dryer
type: custom:timer-bar-card
debug: false
duration:
  attribute: initial_time
remain_time:
  attribute: remain_time
```

### Use with unsupported entities

By default, the card will look for `duration`, `remaining`, `start_time`, or `end_time` attribute on your entity.

You can find a subset of these attributes in the entity popup, and a full list by going visiting the Developer Tools:

<img alt="Developer Tools Screenshot " src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/devtools.png" />

**STEP ONE**: Assign `active_state`, `pause_state`, and `waiting_state` if your entity's states are not included in the defaults (refererence the example above). If your `active_state` is not a constant, set `guess_mode` to true and the card will try to guess the mode. You can also use `state_attribute` to fetch the state from a specific attribute.

> This is the most important step! Without `active_state` properly set, the progress bar will not appear.

**STEP TWO**: Turn on card debug mode by adding `debug: true` to the yaml configuration.

**STEP THREE**: Then follow these steps in order to figure out what you need:

#### 1. My entity has an attribute that looks like `duration` (for example, `timespan`). Supply the following configuration:

```yaml
duration: { attribute: "timespan" } # If your your duration attribute looks like 0:10:00.
debug: true
```

The entity's start time will be computed using the `last_changed` property (when the entity state last changed).

#### 2. My `duration` isn't in the `0:10:00` format! I need to use different units!

Use the `units` property and specify `seconds`, `hours`, or `minutes`. The default value of `units` is `duration`, which expects colons in the duration.

```yaml
duration:
  attribute: "timespan" # Should look like 10 or 10.0
  units: minutes
debug: true
```


#### 3. The time last changed doesn't approximate the start time well enough, and my entity has a duration-looking attribute and a start time attribute (called `start`).

```yaml
duration: { attribute: "timespan" }
start_time: { attribute: "start" }
debug: true
```

#### 4. The entity has no duration attribute but it has start time and end time (`finishes_at`) attributes.

```yaml
start_time: { attribute: "start" }
end_time: { attribute: "finishes_at" }
debug: true
```

Duration will be computed as the difference between these two times. You can also omit start time if you only have an `end_time`, in which case the `last_changed` property is used as the start time.

#### 5. My entity has no attributes!

Imagine we have a **switch** that will always turn off **five minutes** later after it's turned on. *Timer bar card, can we do it? Yes we can!* All it needs is a fixed duration and some love. Always love.

<img alt="Screenshot " src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/switch.png" width="453" height="84" />

> Make sure you have an automation to turn the switch off! See [this test file](https://github.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/blob/main/test/switch-automation.test.ts) for an example.

```yaml
# Did you make an automation in the Home Assistant configuration?
type: custom:timer-bar-card
entities:
  - switch.my_switch
duration: { fixed: 0:05:00 } # 5 min
```

Like in step 1, there is no `start_time` configured so the card will use the time the switch was last toggled as the start time.

#### 6. My duration actually comes from another entity

So far, `duration` has taken on type `attribute` and `fixed`. But there's a third type: `entity`! Assume there's a duration slider with id `input_number.slider1`.

```yaml
type: custom:timer-bar-card
debug: true
entities:
  - switch.my_switch # ID of the switch, which provides the active/idle status
duration:
  entity: input_number.slider1
  units: minutes # Since the slider state is a number like 10.0
```

#### 7. My end time comes from the entity's state

End times and durations can use any of the types `attribute`, `fixed`, `entity` (you've seen these 3 before) and `state`! The `state` type uses the entity's current state. Let's say we have a timer who's state is the time it will go off, like `2021-09-07T20:24:13+00:00`! Here's how to configure the card:

```yaml
end_time: { state: true }
```

#### 8. If your entity doesn't meet these criteria...

üß° please create an issue and tell me the entity so I can improve these instructions! ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è

> You may notice you cannot set `remaining`. This is because for Home Assistant timers, `remaining`  behaves much like `duration`, so to keep my own sanity I assume `remaining`=`duration`. Since they are equal, you don't need both! Just use `duration`!

### Embedded in an entities card

    type: custom:timer-bar-card
  - entity: timer.alarm_two
    type: custom:timer-bar-card
  - entity: timer.alarm_three
    type: custom:timer-bar-card
```

### Icons and entity in card header

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/header-icons.png" alt="Screenshot" width="477" height="243" />

```yaml
entities:

  - timer.water_timer2
  - timer.water_timer3
type: custom:timer-bar-card
icon: mdi:water-outline
active_icon: mdi:water
compressed: true
header_entity: binary_sensor.sprinklers
header_secondary: last-changed
```

Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml

  water_timer:
    name: Front Lawn
    duration: "00:15:00"
  water_timer_2:
    ...

template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Sprinklers"
        icon: mdi:sprinkler-variant
        state: "{{ states.timer| selectattr('state', 'in', ['paused', 'active'] ) | list | count }}"
```

    bar_foreground: orange
    active_icon: mdi:fire
    bar_height: 12px
  - elapsed: 70%
    bar_foreground: red
    active_icon: mdi:fire-alert
```

For each modification, you have the option of using `remaining` or `elapsed` to filter based on the time left or total time remaining in the timer. You can also use percentages (`40%` = 40% of duration) or durations (`0:00:10` = 10 seconds). See [my comment here](https://github.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/issues/21#issuecomment-940750817) for a more detailed example!

All modifications that match are applied, with the last modification having precedence. This means you'll likeley want to list them in increasing order of durations/percentages if using `elapsed` and decreasing order if using `remaining`, so that styles are overridden as the timer progresses farther.

> Do note that `remaining: 1%` is equivalent to `elapsed: 99%`, and that for a 10 second timer `remaining: "00:00:01"` is equivalent to `elapsed: "00:00:09"`.

### Show only progress bar

<img alt="Screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/onlybar.png" width="394" height="66" />

```yaml
type: custom:timer-bar-card
entities:
  - timer.alarm
layout: full_row  # hides the name and icon, but not time remaining
text_width: 0px # hide the time remaining
```

You can also choose to hide only the entity name with `layout: hide_name`.

### Even more options

Want to change the names of the entity statuses because they are in the wrong language or they just aren't cool enough for you? You can do that! Need to use different settings for each entity? You can do that too (replace the entity id with a YAML dict where the `entity` key is the ID, then you can add any other configuration option you like to change it for that entity).

```yaml
type: custom:timer-bar-card
entities:
  - timer.alarm
  - entity: timer.alarm_two
    icon: mdi:circle
    translations:
      idle: Gas, gas, gas!
```

### Use with Paper Buttons Row

<img alt="Screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianadon/timer-bar-card/main/images/button-row.png" width="474" height="91" />

The card supports usage with the amazing [Paper Buttons Row](https://github.com/jcwillox/lovelace-paper-buttons-row) element! You can add `extend_paper_buttons_row` to your configuration to add buttons to the side of the card!

> Not all options (namely `hide_badge` and `hide_state`) are not supported. Please create an issue if you need these.

```yaml
type: custom:timer-bar-card
entities:
  - timer.alarm
extend_paper_buttons_row:
  position: right
  buttons:
    - icon: mdi:party-popper
```

## Manual installation

1. Download `timer-bar-card.js` from the [latest release][release] and move this file to the `config/www` folder.
2. Ensure you have advanced mode enabled (accessible via your username in the bottom left corner)
3. Go to Configuration -> Lovelace Dashboards -> Resources.
4. Add `/local/timer-bar-card.js` with type JS module.
5. Refresh the page? Or restart Home Assistant? The card should eventually be there.

## Using in your own custom cards

If you're publishing a custom card for Lovelace and would like to use the timer bar card inside of it, you can install the card via NPM as a dependency:

```fish
npm install --save lovelace-timer-bar-card
```

To avoid conflicts with the `timer-bar-card-entity-row` element this plugin defines, you'll need to give your custom element a different tag name.

```typescript
import { fillConfig, TimerBarEntityRow } from 'lovelace-timer-bar-card/src/timer-bar-entity-row';

// Assign the tag <my-card-timer-bar-entity-row> to the entity row element
window.customElements.define('my-card-timer-bar-entity-row', TimerBarEntityRow);

// Use like this
const config = fillConfig({
    // extra customization on top of default config
});
return html`<my-card-timer-bar-entity-row
              .config=${config} .hass=${hass}
            ></my-card-timer-bar-entity-row>`;
```

For an example of using the timer bar card as a dependency, you can view [the source code of the OpenSprinkler card](https://github.com/rianadon/opensprinkler-card/blob/main/src/opensprinkler-card.ts).

## Themes? Multicolored icons? Where?

The green and reddish-orange theme (which I called Earth) as well as the gradient theme can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rianadon/b2b798cf27c6c609d19855abb9ed61f7). Neither are polished and both need work.

For multicolored icons, you can use this super-duper-hacky frontend module [here](https://gist.github.com/rianadon/83a341fbbf94c7dedd60d7f58b6d84e0) until some form of support officially lands in Home Assistant. I would not rely on my module. Its purpose is merely to produce pretty screenshots.

#  Troubleshooting

## Sync Issues
**Home Assistant Time**: All Home Assistant timers, automations, etc. are run using the local time of whatever device is running Home Assistant, be it a Raspberry Pi, virtual machine, etc. If the timer will do something important at 5 PM, it will happen whenever your Home Assistant device thinks 5 PM is.

**App Time**: One often views the Home Assistant dashboard on another device like a phone or tablet. These devices have separate clocks, and often they are synced using the [Network Time Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol). If the syncing is set up correctly, the two clocks will never drift more than 10 or so milliseconds apart.

Home Assistant does not provide any API to figure out what it believes the time to be. Instead, the card reads the time from the app (Home Assistant App or browser) to calculate how much time remains in a timer. Any discrepancies between the two times will affect the accuracy of the card. If the clocks are more than one second out of sync, *the card will display an incorrect amount of time remaining*.

If the Home Assistant and App Times are more than 0.5 seconds out of sync, the card will display a warning to alert you of the problem. In this case, I suggest you first visit a website such as [time.is](https://time.is/) or [use the command line](https://askubuntu.com/questions/741298/how-to-get-datetime-using-curl-command) to compare each device's time to a trustworthy source (such as time.is or Google's server). Usually, one device will have an accurate time while the other won't. Make sure the inaccurate device has NTP correctly set up (here's a guide for [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrytips.com/time-sync-raspberry-pi/)). For other devices, the system preferences will often have a setting like "Set time and date automatically" that should be enabled).

If you cannot synchronize the clocks, you can configure the card to calculate how out-of-sync they are and adjust its clock to match Home Assistant's clock. Please note this option may not be a reliable solution for the problem:
```yaml
sync_issues: fix
```

You can also simply disable the card's warning using the following configuration option:
```yaml
sync_issues: ignore
```
